# Citi-Bike Analytics
Please find the full analysis with visuals at: https://public.tableau.com/profile/shaymus.mcteague#!/vizhome/Citi-Bike-Analytics_15873297504980/AlookatJerseyCityridership2018-2019

## Overall Ridership
To best understand the use of Citibike within Jersey City of the years of 2018 and 2019, it’s important to first take a step back and understand what sort of numbers we’ve seen come from both years. Total ridership increased 14.4% year-over-year; but is not quite as interesting as the dichotomy in membership rates and single-time users which both increased 9.1% and 94.1%, respectively. 

Though, the single-time user-rates are drastically smaller than those of subscribers; this may point to a potential want from the market to be able to purchase easier, without a subscription. 

Outside of that, there is a clear correlation of usage during particularly warmer months compared to colder. On the next page, we’ll review how this affects daily usage during those times.

## Summer vs. Winter
Immediately, we see that there is a daily rhythm to Citibike hires; which appears to correlate to daily with typical ‘rush hour’ times. However, if we go a bit more granularly to look at only weekend, the curve is much more bell-shapes over the course of the day. Further research shows that the amount of Citibike hires on Saturday’s and Sunday’s average only about 35% of a weekday. So, one thing learned here is that Citibike is highly used for commuting to work.

## Most and Least Popular Stations
With the knowledge that Citibikes are being used often for commuting, then we should see the same bike pick-up station and drop-off stations being used. As a commuter will pick up from one location and will at some point return (even if with a different bike) to the same location. As we can see, the data supports this narrative. Meaning, it is important to assure that bikes are available in the morning for commuters; and return spaces available in the evening.
Looking at the least popular start and end stations, it could bring us to question if the start locations are worth maintaining if some are receiving less that 100 starts over a two-year period. And the bottom ten end station data can be ignored, as it is reflecting bike pick-ups conducted outside of our designated Citibike locations.

## Age and Gender
Our initial review of age and gender demographics has not uncovered anything alarming but would drive me to suggest a change in data collection and in marketing.

Data: It’s clear that the age data is compromised. The data below is truncated, as the full dataset has a lot of Citibike customers in the 100+ age range. Making the whole dataset suspect. Either we stop collecting birthdate, or find a more reliable way to collect and maintain this data.

Marketing: Men make up a large majority of our clientele. If we are to change this, we need to find out why women are choosing not to use Citibike. 
 -Are pick-up and drop-off locations well-lit and are there CCTV cameras? If not, can we do something to improve lighting and safety?
 -Do women tend to commute by bike less? If so, what would lead them to start commuting by bike?

## Map
In viewing the below maps, on the left we have start locations and on the right, we have end locations. What’s cool to see is not just how often our Jersey City locations are used, but also how far some of our bikes make it throughout NYC and the boroughs; helping us to understand how our bikes are used.

## Main Take-Aways
1. Our main users are commuters, we need to focus our operations to support their needs.
2. A major portion of commuters (women) are not using Citibikes. We must find a way to make Citibike more attractive to them.
3. All warm months – not just summer – is when we see a stark increase in riders. Citi needs marketing to step up incentives to continue using Citibike other ride-hire programs and operations must make sure our supply is meeting demand in high traffic areas.
